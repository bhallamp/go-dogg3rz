# Dogg3rz is the Git for Metadata

Welcome to the Dogg3rz project! Dogg3rz is data's best friend :)

## Overview

Dogg3rz (pronounced Dog-erz) is a decentralized version control management tool for Metadata. Dogg3rz seeks to address the disparity that exists between the development of logic and data in our digital knowledge infrastructure.

Through Open Source, with Git as it's catalyzing agent, the software development community has at their disposal unfettered access to a plethora of software libraries, components, and frameworks  with no barriers to discover, use, and share source code for their projects.

However, no equivalent  exists for the worldwide data community to share in the development of a global metadata commons. Dogg3rz seeks to address the visibility, accessibility, and usability issues of metadata and the data it describes.

The realization of these goals will result in a community curated environmentfor metadata that spans utility across organizations, industries, and domains.

## Approach

The Dogg3rz project views logic and data as intrinsically intertwined elements that compose our digital knowledge infrastructure. They share fundamentally common characteristics in composability through their respective building blocks.   As such, the Dogg3rz Project seeks to leverage these common characteristics to provide an equivalent development environment to develop metadata projects where data developers can curate, version, relate, share,  and combine metadata with other Dogg3rz projects to collectively stitch together a global metadata commons.

## Contributing

The Dogg3rz Project is a work in progress. As such, there's a few things you can do right now to help out:

-   **Ask questions**! We'll try to help. Be sure to drop a note (on the above issue) if there is anything you'd like to work on and we'll update the issue to let others know. Also [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io) on Slack.
-   **Open issues**, [file issues](https://github.com/datacequia/go-dogg3rz/issues), submit pull requests!
-   **Perform code reviews**. More eyes will help a) speed the project along b) ensure quality and c) reduce possible future bugs.
-   **Take a look at the code**. Contributions here that would be most helpful are **top-level comments** about how it should look based on your understanding. Again, the more eyes the better.
-   **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
