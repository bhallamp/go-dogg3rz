Welcome to the Dogg3rz Project. Dogg3rz is data's best friend!

## Vision 

The Dogg3rz Project seeks to enable  the orchestration of living knowledge through self-service cross-organizational collaboration of composable linked data products that fulfill [FAIR Principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618.pdf) and embody the [architectural quantum of Data Mesh that defines the Data Product](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html#LogicalArchitecturedataProductTheArchitecturalQuantum).

## Overview

Dogg3rz is a tool to create, build, self-publish, deploy and collaborate on versioned linked data products on the decentralized web.  Linked data products are portable meta-containers  of all the data, metadata, and polyglot logic necessary to function independently.  Dogg3rz  also enables the discovery and use of other linked data products in a composable way on the open internet. 


## Approach

Dogg3rz  leverages a combination of W3C  standards and common cloud native services in conjunction with emergent  Web 3 Technologies.  The [JSON-LD](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) document  is used as a representational data model for linked data; whereas [decentralized identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) (DIDs) serve as self-sovereign, globally unique, and verifiable identifiers for the data products and those who use them.  Dogg3rz uses container and Serverless technologies to apply reactive behavior to your data .   The final packaging, delivery, and streaming update notifications  of your linked data product  are performed by the [Interplanetary File System](https://ipfs.io) (IPFS).  IPFS encapsulates and persists your linked data product components through an immutable snapshot that can be referenced and used anywhere through its verifiable [content identifiers](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/content-addressing/) (CIDs). 


## Contributing

The Dogg3rz Project is a work in progress. As such, there's a few things you can do right now to help out:

-   **Ask questions**! We'll try to help. Be sure to drop a note (on the above issue) if there is anything you'd like to work on and we'll update the issue to let others know. Also [get in touch](https://slack.textile.io) on Slack.
-   **Open issues**, [file issues](https://github.com/datacequia/go-dogg3rz/issues), submit pull requests!
-   **Perform code reviews**. More eyes will help a) speed the project along b) ensure quality and c) reduce possible future bugs.
-   **Take a look at the code**. Contributions here that would be most helpful are **top-level comments** about how it should look based on your understanding. Again, the more eyes the better.
-   **Add tests**. There can never be enough tests.
